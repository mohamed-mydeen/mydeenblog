        <div className="space-y-6 text-[15px] text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 leading-[1.85] text-justify">
          <p>
            I am Mohamed Mydeen, born in 2005 in Melapalayam, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, where I was also raised. Melapalayam is more than just my hometown — it is the place where my childhood memories, friendships, and some of the most beautiful moments of my life were created.
          </p>

          <p>
            I began my early education in Melapalayam, completing my LKG and UKG there. Later, I started my 1st standard in Kayalpatnam, but life brought an unexpected and painful turning point at a very young age. During that time, I lost my father. At an age where I could not fully understand the meaning of such a loss, life had already begun teaching me difficult lessons.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that, I continued my education back in Melapalayam. During my early academic years, studies were not my strength. I often struggled, failed in exams, and lacked confidence in myself.
          </p>

          <div className="pt-6 border-t border-slate-100 dark:border-white/5 space-y-4">
            <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-lg text-slate-900 dark:text-white">The Turning Point</h3>
            <p>
              But my life changed completely during 7th standard.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that crucial stage, one of my teachers — a person I will always remain deeply grateful to — noticed my situation, understood what I was going through, and spoke to me with genuine care and guidance.
            </p>
            <p className="italic text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 font-medium">
              "That conversation became the single most important turning point in my life. Her words awakened something inside me. For the first time, I truly realized that my circumstances did not have to decide my future. I understood that if I believed in myself and worked hard, I could change my path."
            </p>
            <p>
              That moment transformed my mindset. I made a promise to myself that I would study seriously and build a better future. By the very next examination, I went from being a student who struggled and failed to securing 2nd rank in my class.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[13px] text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-500 italic">
              I sincerely pray that God blesses that teacher abundantly, because her guidance changed the direction of my life forever.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            From then onward, confidence replaced fear. Hard work replaced doubt. Success became part of my journey. I gradually became one of the top-performing students in my class.
          </p>

          <p>
            By 9th standard, life became even more meaningful and beautiful, thank God. Despite family struggles, emotional challenges, and hardships, I continued moving forward with patience, faith, and determination.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic journey reached an important milestone in my 12th standard, proving to myself how far transformation can take a person.

            One of the proudest recognitions in my student life was being awarded Best Student of the Year (2022–2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            This recognition was not given solely for academic performance. It was awarded to students who demonstrated discipline, respectful behavior toward teachers, good character, consistency, responsibility, prayerfulness, and positive conduct in all aspects of student life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers shortlisted a select group of deserving students, and the final decision was made through voting. By the grace of God, I was selected as the winner. This achievement meant far more than an award — it represented the values, character, and discipline I had worked to build.
